## Project Architecture

The project is structured around a convolutional neural network (CNN) that is trained to extract and compare facial features from images. The architecture includes layers for convolution, pooling, and fully connected neural networks that together enable accurate face recognition.


## Key Features
- Preprocessing of images for face detection and alignment
- Feature extraction using a pre-trained CNN.
- Face verification and identification

## Usage
**Clone the repository:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Face_Recognition_Project.git
```
**Navigate to the project directory:**
```bash
cd Face_Recognition_Project
```
**Install the required dependencies:**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
**Run the Jupyter Notebook to see the implementation:**
```bash
jupyter notebook Face_Recognition.ipynb
```
## Results

The face recognition system is capable of accurately identifying and verifying individuals in various images. The performance is demonstrated through a series of tests and visualizations in the provided Jupyter Notebook.
